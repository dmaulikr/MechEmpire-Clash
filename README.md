## Intro
`MechEmpire-Clash` is a multiplayer 3d shooting game, players can join the game and control their robots either with their mobile device (with support of EA pathfinder API), or with classical mouse and keyboard. A lot of weapons and engines with a variety of features is available (current demo contains about 60%). 

## Inspiration
The `MechEmpire-Clash` is supposed to be an extension of my previous project [MechEmpire](http://mechempire.cn), an AI agent game programming tournament platform. The `Mechempire` is designed to interesting and make people learn coding via writing their AI Agents. The `MechEmpire-Clash` is based on the same game idea. The game core is rewritten in Unity C# (Mech AI platform: C++). The game is aiming to get more people involved in happy coding and make them able to combat with the AI agent they write themselves in the future.

## How I built it
Unity3d, EA pathfinder API. (Game concept and 3d models are adapted from my previous project MechEmpire)

## Challenges I ran into
Fighting alone; Adapting to Unity's style structure; 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Help EA find a listener function delete bug in their API; The game is mostly complete, including a number of game details. With EA API, players can join and control with their mobile device which is really fun to clash with several players together.

## What I learned
Info about EA pathfinders API. Ways to communicate between unity and web.

## What's next for MechEmpire-Clash
Extend the AI part so that AI agent program from MechEmpire can be directly used in the Clash
**TODO**: improve the control pannel web page.
